## Java Developer Technical Test

## Overview

MoneySuperMarket have gone Bitcoin crazy and decided to allow their customers to keep an 
eye on the best exchanges with the highest selling price.

Create a system that calls the below bitcoin exchanges to retrieve selling price information:

 * https://blockchain.info/ticker
 * https://api.exmo.com/v1/ticker

It should find the exchange with the best (highest) price and returns the price and the exchange name.


## Stretch

We've done a deal with a new exchange and would like to include their prices in the application.

The new Api is:
https://api.bitfinex.com/v1/pubticker/btcusd

(hint - you'll need the ask price)
